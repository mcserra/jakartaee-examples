# An EESecurity JWT example

This example demonstrates how to use JWT authentication/authorization.

## Authentication

Authenticate using `/login`, and a token will be received in the header.

## Authorization
``
The endpoints in `FruitResource` are role based, so they will only be accessible to some roles.
